This is a dummy project created for codecamp purposes. It follows the structure of the first page github tutorials on HTMX.

The technologies applied are HTMX for demonstration, express for simple server and pugs as a template language. Povered by JS.

The only cool feature in this repo is a completely unrelated picture.
